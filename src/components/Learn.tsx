            I started by experimenting with HTML and CSS, fascinated by how a
            few lines of code could shape an entire page. I would spend hours
            tinkering with layouts, adjusting colors, and learning how design
            decisions affect usability. What started as curiosity became a
            passion for creating digital experiences that are not only
            functional but also beautiful.

          <p className="mt-2">
            My first projects were far from perfect‚Äîbroken layouts, clunky
            buttons, and messy code. But those projects were stepping stones.
            Each one taught me something new, and with time, I grew more
            confident. I transitioned from static pages to interactive websites
            powered by JavaScript, then discovered React, and later Next.js.
            That journey from beginner to professional wasn&apos;t a straight
            line‚Äîit was full of challenges, but each challenge made me stronger.

            My formal education in Frontend Engineering at Innovation Growth Hub
            gave me the theoretical foundation I needed. I graduated with
            First-Class Honors, focusing on Software Engineering and Web
            Technologies. But what truly shaped me wasn&apos;t only the
            classroom learning‚Äîit was the projects, hackathons, and real-world
            problems we solved as students.

            My career path has been a blend of internships, freelance work, and
            full-time development roles. At <b>IGHUB</b>, I worked as a Frontend
            Developer, where I built and optimized React/Next.js applications. I
            focused on creating scalable solutions, improving SEO rankings, and
            collaborating with designers to deliver user-centered products. It
            was here that I realized the power of teamwork‚Äîhow developers,
            designers, and clients come together to create impactful products.

            At <b>Young Directors Tech Hub</b>, I joined as a Fullstack Intern.
            I contributed to backend APIs with Node.js and MongoDB, built
            dashboards with real-time analytics, and helped migrate legacy
            systems to modern architectures. That role gave me exposure to the
            full stack of development, from server to client, teaching me the
            importance of clean architecture and scalability.

          When I wrote my very first &quot;Hello World&quot; program, I had no
          idea it would change the direction of my life. What began as curiosity
          soon turned into long nights of problem-solving, hours spent debugging
          stubborn code, and the thrill of seeing something I built come alive
          on the web. That excitement has carried me from small static projects
          to full-stack applications serving real users.

          that failure is just another step toward mastery. Every new framework
          I learned opened doors to opportunities I couldn&apos;t have imagined
